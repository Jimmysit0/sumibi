#+TITLE: Sumibi

* What's this?
  This is my personal Emacs config based on [[https://github.com/ogdenwebb/snug-emacs][snug-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]]. 

* Dependencies
  You need the Comic Code & Captain Code fonts. 

  You also need [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] (Both 27.x and 28.x work.), but that's pretty obvious isn't it?

* Install
  Move all the files to an entirely clean ~/.emacs.d

* Shortcuts
