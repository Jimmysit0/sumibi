* What's this?
  This is my personal Emacs config, based on [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][GNU Emacs / N Î› N O]]

* Dependencies
  [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/releases/download/5.2/Fira_Code_v5.2.zip][Fira Code]] & [[https://github.com/googlefonts/RobotoMono][Roboto Mono]] are the only dependencies.

  You also need [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]], but that's pretty obvious isn't it?

* Install
  Move all the files to an entirely clean ~/.emacs.d
